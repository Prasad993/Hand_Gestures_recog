hello

I have used 3 gestures from the data set.
3 gestures are:
    1.palm
    2.ok
    3.fist
I used 800 images of each to train the model and 200 image each to test the model
total train images are 2400
total test images are 600

step I= is to preprocessing the images which including scaling,zooming, class,targetsize
stepII= model bulding using cnn
step III=compliling and training
Step IV =prediction

i also make prediction using single images wich were not present in the traning as wll as testing data
